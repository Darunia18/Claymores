Claymores
=========

This is the source code to my PocketMine plugin Claymores, being coded in the new API (1.0.0).

All the versions released on here will always be in a semi-working condition, and if there are any bugs, they will be stated with the commit. I may post commits on here to share my development with others and get other developers' insight and suggestions.

If you wish to download any official releases of this plugin, they will be posted at http://forums.pocketmine.net/plugins/claymores.263/
